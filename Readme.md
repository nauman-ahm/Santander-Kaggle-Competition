Welcome to my Github page! This particular repository includes an attempt to build the most accurate model to predict customer transaction probability.
The various classifiers I used were logistic regression, naive-bayes, and XGBoost.

Important technical notes:
Performance metric: ROC_AUC (Area under ROC curve)
Independant feature space: 200 continuous variables
Dependant feature space: Binary (0 and 1)

Please note: Due to size of data, I am unable to save the train.csv/test.csv files provided by the company. You can download them via:

In order to replicate script, please reconfigure the file input steps of the code.
